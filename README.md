# CSS calc() Spacing Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle but important issue with the `calc()` function in CSS.  Incorrect spacing around operators in `calc()` expressions can lead to unexpected results or parsing errors.

The `bug.css` file contains examples of incorrectly spaced `calc()` expressions.  The `bugSolution.css` file shows the corrected versions with proper spacing.

The key takeaway is to be mindful of spacing within `calc()`, particularly when dealing with multiple operations or units.
