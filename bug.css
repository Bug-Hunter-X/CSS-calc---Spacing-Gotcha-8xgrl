The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there's a common pitfall: spaces around the operators are sometimes needed, sometimes not, and the rules aren't always intuitive.  Incorrect spacing can lead to unexpected results or parsing errors.

For example, this will likely fail:
```css
width: calc(100% - 20 px);
```

The correct version is:
```css
width: calc(100% - 20px);
```

Another example:

Incorrect:
```css
margin: calc( (100vw - 1000px) /2 );
```
Correct:
```css
margin: calc((100vw - 1000px) / 2);
```
